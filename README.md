**Unity** is a great game engine that allows you to build apps for lots of platforms: Mac/Windows/Linux, Android, iOS... and even VR headsets! Setting up a VR project can be a bit of a headache, because even if there are ready-made templates, you still have to configure quite a lot.

But you know what's even harder? Actually **building and distributing your VR game**!

Thanks to [Codemagic](https://unitycicd.com/) and the [Oculus CLI tools](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/publish-reference-platform-command-line-utility/), however, it's possible to **automate all this publishing process** and set up a robust build pipeline :)

In this repo, I share a simple VR app called "IcoPop" that is intended for Oculus headsets. Your goal is to shoot at the incoming "ico-targets" to destroy them before they hit you!
